	NEWBIE AT THE GYM? FOLLOW THESE GYM RULES:
	</h1>
	<h3 class="lead">Hitting The Weight Room/ Spinning Class/ Tradmill For The First Time In A While? Take Our Guide And Follow The Steps To Avoid Being That Person.</h3>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8">
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Do Not Hesitate</b></h5>
	The biggest fear of a gym goer is body shaming. An Ectomorph thinks he will be looking funny if he does exercise and lifts weight, An Endomorph thinks everyone will make fun of his belly fat if he goes to the gym, so 90% of these people stay in their natural forms just because of the fear, they vould have changed their bodies but they hesitate going to the gym.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Put Down Your Cell Phone</b></h5>
	"There is no better way to show you're a newbie than to be on a piece of equipment talking or texting; it will annoy the other members around you," says Pete McCall, San Diego-based ACE-certified personal trainer. "Think of your exercise time as a chance to "disconnect" and be device-free for an hour or so." Listening to music? That's a go. Need to take a call? Most health clubs have dedicated "cell phone" spots you can use. If the temptation is too much to bear, opt for a music-only device, like an iPod shuffle, so you won't be tempted to message while you work out. Side note: Texting and running is really hard.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Max Out Your Bennies</b></h5>
	Many gym memberships come with additional perks, especially if you sign up around the first of the year, when they're hyper-competing in the local market. Most health clubs provide one or two complimentary personal training sessions, and some offer spa and gear discounts. "This is a good opportunity to learn about everything the facility has to offer and meet a member of the fitness staff who can be a good resource for your fitness needs," says McCall. If your gym doesn't provide extras, try to negotiate something like one free personal training session if you sign up that day. Smaller gyms will be more likely to work with you.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Avoid Wardrobe Malfunction</b></h5>
	Well-fitted clothing will boost your confidence and make you less self-conscious. And, of course, ensure you avoid this-that-and-the-other slip. "You may not end up pulling a Janet Jackson, but there are plenty of ways your old, ill-fitting gym clothes can let you down," says Jessi Kneeland, a certified personal trainer at Peak Performance NYC. "As tempting as it is to just throw on some old rags—and, yes, I'm talking about that T-shirt you've had since the ninth?grade—it's worth investing in a few key gym pieces." Kneeland also warns about trying to pass off your regular bra as a sports bra. Trust us, not a good idea. Support your girls!
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Don't Get Burned Out</b></h5>
	Setting your goals high and committing to getting fit is great—but going to the gym every single day until your legs give out or lifting too-heavy weights isn't the way to start your new regimen. "It's not a competition," says Kneeland. "It's your life." Getting into great shape takes time, consistency and patience. "It will require you staying committed to your goals even during your less-motivating-but-equally-important rest days. And it will definitely require a lifestyle shift to make fitness, recovery, and healthy eating a regular part of your life. You can't speed that process up, so embrace it."
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Ask For Help</b></h5>
	As with anything new, it takes some time to acquaint yourself with the gym and those weird pieces of equipment. Instead of avoiding them, ask the front desk if there is a trainer that can show you how to use the equipment and machines. That's what they are there for. It's better to learn how to do it right than become injured by trying it on your own!.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Think 'Use and Move'</b></h5>
	Circuit workouts are incredibly effective. When you can dash between the rowing machine, a kettlebell station, the treadmill and a medicine ball you can do an efficient workout. But Gunnar Peterson, a Beverly Hills-based personal trainer, says that gym members should avoid monopolizing multiple stations or pieces of equipment all at once. It's a courtesy to other gym members and you'll be thankful when others do the same.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Be Spatially Aware</b></h5>
	Think that just because you're only staking claim to one spot on the gym floor that you're not bugging anyone else? Not necessarily. Don't do big movements in tight spaces, says Peterson. Jump roping and big kicking or stretching movements should be reserved for less populated areas of the floor.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Don't Neglect The Hidden Gems</b></h5>
	Maybe you're stuck in line for a treadmill, or over set after set of hand weights. Talk to a trainer and you'll find there are plenty of other machines in the gym that can get you a killer workout, whether you're looking to strength train or sculpt muscle. Some may take a few tries to master, but once you do, this type of cross-training will do you good.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Get With The Group</b></h5>
	Many classes are complimentary with your membership. However, make sure you are aware of the rules before you go. Are sign-ups required? Do you need to wear any special clothing? Then, arrive early so you can speak with the instructor if it's your first time.
	And finally...
	Cover Up. No, Seriously.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Ignoring proper exercise form</b></h5>
	If you’re doing an exercise like squats or something with free weights with incorrect form, hopefully, someone will come over to help you. Then again, a lot of guys aren’t watching out for that, plus he may not know the exact proper technique himself. Obviously, without proper technique, you’re risking injury any time you do such an exercise, and if you’re lucky, you’ll just feel uncomfortable and won’t gain as much as you should from any given exercise. “Even if you don’t want to hire a trainer on an ongoing basis, I would recommend paying one for a session just to get all of the proper techniques down, whatever exercises you might be interested in,” Ettinger says.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Trying to do too much, too soon</b></h5>
	“Trying to do too much too soon might just set yourself up for failure,” Ettinger says. This is definitely related to the “Spending too much time in the gym” concept, but it’s directed more toward guys who try to go all out for as long as they can, rather than having a casual stay at the gym for hours. If you’re just getting more active again after a long hiatus (or if you’re becoming more active than ever), it’s important to understand that the results you want won’t come through in a couple weeks of practically kill yourself at the gym. Using that method will only leave you frustrated that you haven’t gone through a very noticeable transformation yet, plus you’ll need too much recovery time, if you don’t get injured first. Slow and steady wins the race – doing too much can lead to burnout.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Not Racking Up Weights</b></h5>
	Using the weights and then leaving them on the floor lying? This is the mistake that a newbie does and shows lack of gym etiquettes. Do not make this mistake because doing this can make others aggressive and oyu might end up with a swollen face.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Craving For Protein Shakes Too Quickly</b></h5>
	Most of the gym going teenagers think that protein shakes/ mass gainers/ supplements are the only things neccessary to build the body. If you join gym, you must use a protein shake after 3 months of the gym so that your muscles are saturated and are now saturated and able to bear the protein amount going to enter in the muscles. 
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Blindly Following The Diet Of A Pro Athlete</b></h5>
	The Google is the best source of knowledge in today's world, but relying blindly and without using your mind can get you in trouble. blindly following the diet of pro athletes will not let you gain weight or make you muscular like thm, everyone is built differently and the time taken by a pro athlete to get to that point of nutrition is damn high, you might feel bad, but you should consult your trainer for a diet plan.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Going Too Heavy</b></h5>
	Going to the gym and lifting heavy ass weights is a thing everyone wants to do, But going too heavy too soon just because you read that on a t shirt and motivational posters on the gym wall. You better not do this. Our muscles take time. and bigger the muscles, more the weight lifted. But dont hurry up, there have been incidents where people end up breaking bones in the gym due to ego-lifting.
	<h5 style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Focus On The Compound Movements</b></h5>
	An Ideal Workout Must be of 45-minutes for a beginner and 4-5 exercises per body part. The exercises should be such that 60% of the exercises are of  free weights and 40%on machines.
